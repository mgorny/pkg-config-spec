Introduction
------------

pkg-config is a helper tool for obtaining correct compiler & linker
flags suitable to satisfying application dependencies. It was designed
to be platform- and language-agnostic, and to support installing
dependencies in any locations without the need for explicitly specifying
those locations every time an application is built.

Sadly, the official pkg-config_ implementation had a few deficiencies.
Most importantly, the upstream decided to use the glib_ and popt_
libraries. The latter being redundant and having portability problems,
the former being quite large and causing circular dependencies (since
glib's build required pkg-config itself), they limited the popularity
and usefulness of pkg-config [1]_.

The fore-mentioned deficiencies of the official implementation has
caused a number of alternative implementations to arose. Amongst them
there were the `OpenBSD implementation`_ in Perl, and pkgconf_
in ANSI C. The work on those implementations and the experience in using
them has shown that pkg-config lacks proper documentation. The only
official documentation on it are the `man page`_ and a short tutorial-
style Guide_.

Thus, I have decided to write a complete and detailed specification of
how pkg-config works based on the experiences with implementing
pkgconf [2]_. The goal is to provide a complete, well-organized guide
which would prove useful both to end-users, and to people trying to
create or improve their own pkg-config implementation.

.. [1] The redundant popt dependency has been finally removed lately,
       and the necessary glib parts started to be bundled along with
       pkg-config in order to simplify bootstrap.
